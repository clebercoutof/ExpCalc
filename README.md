-The logic used is based on stacks and queues to create an RPN notation and then solve it
-It includes a function that checks if there are any letters in the expressions and another one that checks if the brackets and parentheses are balanced

# Tree Expression Calculator
#This python script creates a parsing tree and solve it. But it needs parenthesis in every expression,EX:((2+2)*(2/4)), and it supports only the basic operations ('+','-','*','/'), since the new node is activated by parenthesis. The code was part based on the interactivepython.org tree class.
